        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, I’m Riya, a second-year Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) student with a strong passion for technology and a keen interest in programming, web development, and software design. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by how technology shapes our world, and my academic journey has deepened that curiosity.  
            
            Throughout my studies, I’ve developed a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C, along with experience in web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and databases like SQL. I am particularly interested in building responsive and dynamic web applications, which led me to work on projects like weather apps and interactive websites. These projects have helped me improve my problem-solving skills and enhanced my understanding of front-end and back-end development.
            
            As a student, I constantly seek opportunities to learn and grow. Whether it’s through online courses, personal projects, or hands-on practice, I am dedicated to mastering new tools and technologies. I am particularly excited about exploring areas like mobile app development, artificial intelligence, and data science. My ultimate goal is to leverage my skills to create innovative software solutions that make a real impact. I look forward to further developing my expertise and contributing to the tech industry. <br><br> <br><br>
